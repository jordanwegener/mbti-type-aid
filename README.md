# MBTI Cognitive Function Typing App

This is a simple app designed to help users identify someone's MBTI type using cognitive functions. The app provides a list of MBTI types along with their cognitive function stacks and allows users to drag and drop cognitive functions to create a custom stack. As you build your stack, the app will filter and display the closest matching MBTI types in real-time, ordered by the closest match to the stack you have created.

## Features

- **MBTI Type List**: View a list of all MBTI types along with their cognitive function stacks.
- **Drag and Drop Interface**: Drag cognitive functions from a provided list and drop them to build your own stack.
- **Real-Time Filtering**: As you build your stack, the app filters and displays potential MBTI types, ordered by the closest match.

## Future Enhancements

- **Detailed Type Information**: Click on any MBTI type to view detailed information about it.
- **Custom Function Weights**: Assign custom weights to cognitive functions to refine the matching process.
- **User Profiles**: Save and compare different typing profiles for the same individual.
